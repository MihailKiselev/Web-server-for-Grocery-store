# Web-server-for-Grocery-store
This is an attempt to create a server for an online grocery store. OOP and synchronicity are used. A database is used MySQL, you can also use OpenServer for quick checking (I do not recommend). There are logical errors in the code and the server is not stable. I know what needs to be done and what to work on. This is just for fun, if possible and out of interest I will update it, maybe it will eventually be a full-fledged good project.
